        Mitchell Robey is a digital artist from Boston, Massachusetts. Since 2013, he has focused primarily on marketing and digital arts as a student at Stetson University. Because of the climate, Disney World, and popularity of Stetson University, he chose to attend college in DeLand, Florida. When he first arrived at Stetson, he did not know many people because he was about 1,000 miles away from home. Attending Hatter Trek his freshman year, be began to develop leadership skills that guided him through many different job opportunities. From becoming the lead graphics operator for ESPN3 college sports at Stetson Broadcasting to working with Homecoming three years in a row. Outside of digital arts, he is interested in athletics, such as flag football and baseball, as well as having a lead role within the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity, where he currently serves as the Philanthropy chair and Historian. As a senior, he is excited to graduate in the Spring of 2017 to pursue a career within advertising or graphic design.</span>        
        <p>        
        <p>For his final year at Stetson, Mitchell hopes to accomplish his dream of working with a graphic design and marketing firm. Recently, he has signed onto a four-month summer internship with Amica Insurance, a multi-purpose insuranc company based in Lincoln, Rhode Island. Through this internship, he aims to advance his digital arts skills, both cinematically and through graphic design.  In order to prepare him for this internship, he has taken classes on web design, video editing, and 3D modeling and animation.
        <p>Next year, he aims to create a senior project that displays everything he has learned throughout his time at Stetson University. Though he has many ideas for his senior project, he has decided to either focus on a marketing campaign or a documentary film for an organization or event on campus. In the Fall of 2016, he will also contribute to the Stetson Homecoming Committee, where he will serve as the Vice President. Through this position, he hopes to gain faculty approval to display his campaign around campus and make it something that the DeLand and Stetson community can enjoy while also creating awareness on a certain topic not yet decided.</p>
        <p>During his freshman year of college, he took a graphic design course and a video production and editing course. Though he will use the skills he learned at Stetson for his internship, he hopes to take additional classes in audio and video production to enhance his current skills in those areas to their full potential. Currently, I believe there are individuals within the broadcasting department that have completed work that I could use as a model when completing my senior research.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, this project will help me achieve my vision for post-college because it will allow me to explore new areas that I may not have been able to reach due to restrictions and guidelines within some of the classes I have taken at Stetson. Next Spring, I hope to challenge myself and my current skillset in creating a memorable piece of work that I could use in my portfolio while applying to jobs in the future.</p>

      <h1> <b> My Personal Story </b> </h1>
      </div>
    <p> In 2002, while sitting in the John Hancock Tower in Boston, Massachusetts, I began to realize my interest for digital arts while creating a document that featured every member of the Boston Red Sox. From typing each players information to including facts about the team's history, I did not realize that the "copy and paste" function existed. After typing more than 3000 words over the course of a single workday, my mother noticed me struggling as my eyes ran acrossed the screen looking for any last minute information to include. Though this was not a school assignment and something more for my personal portfolio, this was the day I learned how to import images, text, and graphics into programs like Microsoft word and Powerpoint. </p>
      
      <p> Several years later, in 2008, I decided to begin my Digital Arts path by exploring various summer programs related to robotics, animation, web design, and newspaper layout. In 2008, I attended the summer Digital Arts program at Stonehill College where I learned how to code in Dreamweaver, edit photos and create images in Photoshop, and also work with robotics to create a machine that could fight other robots. Two years later in 2010, I also attended the NEIT (New England Institute of Technology) Tech Camp in Provide, Rhode Island where I was the host and graphics operator of the Summer Television station. Though my high school years were focused on rigorous academics including United States History, Sports Business, and Psychology, I quickly realzied that I wanted to attend college in a place that is not only known for their academics, but for the opportunities available. </p>
      
    <p> In 2013, I began my freshman year at Stetson University, a private college located in the beautiful city of DeLand, FL. When coming to Stetson, I did not realize that less than 3 years later, I would have been apart of countless organizations with connections everywhere on campus. As a student at Stetson University, I came to the school with my ideal job being a graphic designer or web designer. Though I realized quickly that I may want to pursue something with more of a managerial role, I kept my passion and dream of working in the field as a Digital Artist. During my sophomore year of college, I took my first marketing course: Marketing and Consumers, which focused on the relationships between products and how the consumer may perceive a particular product. Other classes I have taken include Sports Properties and Sponsorship, Digital Marketing, and Marketing Analytics. Currently, I am a senior at Stetson Univversity and with my focus more towards the Marketing aspect of things, I have entered my first professional internship with Amica Insurance as a Marketing Coordinator and Digital Designer. </p>
      
    <p> This past January, two Pi Kappa Alpha members and myself created '3 J.A.M Productions,' a video production company with the vision of producing high quality content at a fair rate to film life, people, and events cinematically. Recently, we have worked on various projects including the Florida Atlantic Unviersity (FAU) Student Body Presidential Campaign and athletic highlight videos for Stetson Lacrosse and Football.
