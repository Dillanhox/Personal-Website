<p>During my time at stetson I have taken multiple courses that have furthered my knowledge of the digital arts. I have a strong base in photoshop and digital photography, with a ground understanding of digital painting and graphic design. The Interactivity and Art class sequence taught by Matt Roberts has inspired me for my senior year. For my senior project I would like to focus further on projection mapping and interactivity. My goal would be to work in a group like I have previously done, and fully cover the Rocks in a projection mapping instalation. Thanks to the initial idea and project I composed this year with Ian Felpel, Gerardo Diaz, and Michael Zirpoli, I have the basis to take the project tot the fullest. To take this idea to the finish line I will be taking courses in modeling and animation, as well as adiou and video production. These are the areas in which I lack the strength to really contribute on a lager scale piece of projection mapping the rocks.</p>

<h2>Owl</h2>
<p>This is an image created using most of the basic tools in photoshop, and drawn with a Wacom Intuos Pro tablet. This demonstartes not only my knowldege of photoshop but also my ability to use its tools. My portayal of an owl's eyes and beak provesmy ability to draw and understanding of proportion.</p>

<h2>RedBull Night Riders</h2>
<p>This is an Image that I believe strongly captures the advancement and level of my photography. On a cold November night in Jacksonville I waded out into the water next to the Pier, under the gleaming lights of the event to capture action shots of the six pro surfers competing. This was taken in manual focus, while tracking the surfer, it is by far my favorite shot from that night. </p>

<h2>RockBand Drumset</h2>
<p>As a small project that I started in the first Interactivity and Art course, I used Max 7 to repourpose a Rock Band Drumset for the Xbox 360. Using a wireless receiver to connect it to my PC, I created a patch that allows the user to play base song on loop while playing on top of it with the new midi style drum set. There were four base loops and with each one it's own respective library of sounds ranging from a standard drumset with a kick drum and high hats, to a dub step style bass midi. I created the sound files with the help of Ian Felpel, who is seen playing the drums in the video below. In addition to the interactive play and audio, the patch also allows for the addition of another musical instrument, a repourposed Rock Band guitar in case you have a friend to jam out with. The Max patch also provides the ability of live manipulation of videos selected to match the loops and libraries, by a third party using a standard xbox 360 controller.</p>

<h2>Mike Tyson's Punch Out</h2>
<p>The first project of the Advanced Interactivity and Art course challenged us to create a new controller for an old NES game of our choice. As a fan of fighter gamesand the old fight sticks I chose Mike Tyson's Punch Out to let students play the game as the under dog Little Mac. One player had control of movement and the K.O. punch on the keyboard while the other used Hulkbuster gloves to throw body shots and uppercuts against the enemy. This forces the two players to communicate and work in synch in order to counter and defeat their opponent.</p>

<h2> The Rocks</h2>
<p>Inspired by the challenge to fix something that I believed was broken, I decided to make a new and fun use for the Stetson Rock. An eyesore to many, a spot of serenity and contemplation for others, it is a widely debated addition to the Stetson DeLand campus. While we may never know the true reason of it's appearance we can try and make everyone come together around it. My initial inspriation came from a video in which performance and interactive artists turned a boring old stair way into a piano. This prompted a mvast majority of travellers leaving the train station to use the stairs instead of the escalators. The pianos key steps turned a normaly boring and mundane task of climbing the steps into a fun and musical adventure, similar to Tom Hank's experience at Toys 'R Us in the movie Big. So with the help of my group we created a 3D model of the rocks using reality capture, which we then 3D printed at Stetsons Innovative Lab. We turned the model Rocks into and interactive controller allowing students to play music and light up a portion of the rocks.</p>
